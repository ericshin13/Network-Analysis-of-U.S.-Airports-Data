# Network Analysis of U.S. Airports
This project identified key U.S. airports in the airline network using the betweenness centrality algorithm, which reveals which airports lie on the shortest paths between others, indicating their influence. To clarify the graph, I simplified the code to remove unnecessary loops, increased node sizes, and decreased arrow sizes, making it easier to visualize airports with higher betweenness centrality.
